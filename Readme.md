# nixos-zfs-setup.sh

## Hello, world!

This is a script that sets up new zfs storage pools on your disk(s), for use
with NixOS. It zaps the partition table(s), creates new partitions, sets up two
storage pools (named `bpool` and `rpool` by default), and prepares them for
NixOS installation.

This is a proof of concept and not for beginners. You are free to modify the
commands. The shell code shouldn't be too hard to understand.

This script is based on the instructions from the [NixOS Root on
ZFS](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/NixOS/Root%20on%20ZFS.html)
website, with a few deviations and exceptions:

* It creates the partitions in a different (more sane) order;
* It names the partitions in the GPT table it creates;
* It uses `/dev/disk/partname` rather than `/dev/disk/by-id/*` or `/dev/disk/by-path/*`;
* It (currently) does not support disk encryption;
* It always allocates (but currently does not create and use) a swap partition.

## How to use this script

1.  Boot the NixOS liveCD
2.  If not using DHCP, set up networking inside the live environment.
3.  Open a terminal and login as root: `sudo login -f root`
4.  Set a password (`passwd`).
5.  Restart sshd: `systemctl restart sshd.service`
6.  Login to the shell, `git clone` this repository
7.  Edit the variables in `nixos-zfs-setup.sh`
8.  Optional: wipe existing partitions from the disk with `wipefs -af /dev/...`
9.  Run the script: `bash ./nixos-zfs-setup.sh` and hope for the best.

When the script has finished, it will tell you some commands to run next. Do
this by hand. Note down the instructions first, because the first command will
output a lot of text.

## Tested with:

So far only with qemu. I plan to test it on hardware when I have a chance to.
This may take a long time because I have plenty of other NixOS related stuff to
figure out first.

## Todo

* Properly support/configure/enable the swap partition;
* Add encryption.
